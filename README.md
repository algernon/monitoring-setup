A monitoring setup
==================

This is a monitoring setup, based on [collectd](https://collectd.org/)
and [Riemann](http://riemann.io/). There isn't much documentation yet,
because this is my production config, reusability is not a goal at
all: it's mostly here so others can borrow parts of the setup.

To run this, you will also need
[riemann-extra](https://github.com/pyr/riemann-extra).
